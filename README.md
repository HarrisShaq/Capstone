<!-- # FullStack M.E.R.N. Fashion App

## Overview

This is a FullStack M.E.R.N. (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) Fashion application designed to learn your style and taste in luxury clothing. The ultimate goal of this app is to provide personalized recommendations tailored to your fashion preferences. 

## Purpose

Originally, this app aimed to create an interactive experience where users could receive fashion tips and advice through a virtual concierge. Additionally, users would have the ability to compare prices with other luxury fashion apps and stores, enhancing their shopping experience.

## Features

### Planned Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** The app would analyze your style and suggest luxury clothing options.
- **Interactive Concierge:** Users could receive tailored fashion advice based on their preferences.
- **Price Comparison:** Compare prices across various luxury fashion platforms to find the best deals.
- **Pampering Services:** Ability to schedule discounted pampering services after reaching spending milestones.

### Current Features
Due to various challenges, I had to pivot the project and create my own API using MongoDB, generating the data manually. Key features include:
- User authentication and management.
- Dynamic product listings for clothing, shoes, and accessories.
- Basic search functionality for easy item discovery.
- Cart management and item addition alerts.

## Development Journey

The journey to create this app was filled with late nights and determination, often working until around 3 AM to ensure it functioned at a minimum capacity. Despite facing numerous challenges, the experience was invaluable in enhancing my skills with the M.E.R.N. stack.

## Challenges Faced
- **API Creation:** I encountered issues with initial API integrations, prompting me to build a custom API.
- **Data Generation:** The need to generate sample data for the application to function effectively.
- **Feature Scaling:** Some planned features had to be scaled back or removed to meet deadlines.

## Conclusion

While this application is a work in progress, it serves as a solid foundation for a more expansive fashion platform. The insights gained during this project will guide future improvements and feature implementations. I am excited about the potential of this app and the journey ahead!
